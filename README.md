JBang / Eclipse integration POC
===============================

This experimental plugin aims to let you author [JBang](https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang) scripts in Eclipse with ease.

## Features:

- Import JBang Scripts as projects
- Synchronize JBang Dependencies to existing projects
- Automatically configures JDKs managed by JBang
- Validation of JBang scripts on file save
- Automatic configuration of Annotation Processors
- JBang runtime management

Currently supports 
- `//DEPS` / `@Grab` dependencies
- `//JAVA` version
- `//SOURCES` additional sources 

By default, the plugin will try to find JBang from the PATH, from `~/.jbang/bin` or `~/.sdkman/candidates/jbang/current/bin/jbang`. Alternate locations can be defined in `Preferences` > `JBang` > `Installations`


## Import JBang Script as project

Import JBang scripts in Eclipse: Import Project... > JBang > JBang script.

A project named after the script file will be created in the current workspace, that will link to the real script file.

## Synchronize JBang

The `Synchronize JBang` command is available when right-clicking on a JBang script in an existing project. If the script belongs to a non-Java project, the Java nature will be added to that project. 
The source folder containing the JBang file will automatically be added to the project's classpath. The `JBang Dependencies` classpath container will be added to the classpath as well.

*Caveats*:
- JBang files and dependencies will leak to the project's main and test-scoped sources
- the project's main files and dependencies will leak to the JBang script
- If the script file is at the root of the project and there are other source folders nested beneath that root, compilation errors will occur in those folders
- Other build tools (m2e/buildship) might conflict with the classpath changes. Typically, Updating the Maven project configuration would remove the JBang source folder and its classpath container. Re-running `Synchronize JBang` will be necessary to get completion and validation in JBang scripts.


## Recommended 3rd party plugins

* Automatic source downloads: Currently, JBang dependencies sources are not automatically fetched. You can install the [PDE source lookup](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pde-source-lookup) plugin to automatically download sources from Maven Central, when opening a type from a JBang dependency. 


Installation
------------

_JBang Eclipse Integration_ is available in the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jbang-eclipse-integration). Drag the following button to your running Eclipse workspace. (⚠️ *Requires the Eclipse Marketplace Client*)
